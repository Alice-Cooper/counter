# Simple Counter

Simple Counter is a [tally counter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_counter) for Android.
It makes counting easier. You can have multiple counters with their own names and values.
Values can be changed using volume buttons.

It's my first Android application. The goal was to make something useful (at least for myself)
and easy to build. Simple Counter is available
on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.tsukanov.counter).

I hope you'll find this app useful. ;)
