Simple Counter
==============
It's a [tally counter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_counter) for Android
that can have multiple counters with their own names and values. Thatâ€™s my first
Android application. The goal was to make something useful (at least for myself)
and easy to build.
It's available on [Play Store][1].
