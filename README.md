# Simple Counter

Simple Counter is a [tally counter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_counter) for Android.
It makes counting easier. You can have multiple counters with their own names and values.
Values can be changed using volume buttons.

This is my first Android application. The goal was to make something useful and easy to build.
Simple Counter is available on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.tsukanov.counter).

I hope you'll find this app useful. ;)
