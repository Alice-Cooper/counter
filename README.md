Simple Counter
==============
Simple Counter is a [tally counter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_counter) for Android.
It makes counting easier because you can have multiple counters with their own names and values.
You can change values using volume buttons, turn on sounds, and vibration.

It's my first Android application. The goal was to make something useful (at least for myself)
and easy to build. Feel free to suggest a new feature or submit bug report [here](https://github.com/Tsukanov/Simple-Counter/issues) at GitHub.
I hope you'll find this app useful. ;)

Simple Counter is available on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.tsukanov.counter).
